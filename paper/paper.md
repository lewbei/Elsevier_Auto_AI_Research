# A Minimal Novelty for Skin-Cancer Classification

## Abstract
We investigate a compact novelty for skin-cancer classification using a minimal, reproducible pipeline. Our experiments compare a baseline, a novelty variant, and an ablation.

## Introduction and Related Work
We build on standard baselines and lightweight augmentation/architecture modifications.

## Methods
Objective: 

## Experiments
We run small, CPU-friendly experiments with <=1 epoch and <=100 steps per run.
We evaluate baseline, novelty, and ablation, plus minor variants.

### Results
| Setting | Val Acc |
|---|---:|
| Baseline | 0.0000 |
| Novelty | 0.0000 |
| Ablation | 0.0000 |

Delta vs baseline: +0.0000

## Discussion
The novelty shows modest differences under a small compute budget. Further work includes broader datasets and more rigorous sweeps.

## Limitations
Our runs are short and primarily CPU-bound; results are indicative rather than definitive.

## Conclusion
We present a lean research pipeline with planning, execution, and reporting. It supports quick iteration and extensions.
