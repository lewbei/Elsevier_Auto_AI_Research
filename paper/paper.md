# Draft: Compact Research Report

## Abstract
This report outlines a compact, compute-constrained approach to human pose classification using few-shot deep learning. We propose a lightweight episodic training pipeline based on metric learning (prototype-based classification) intended to run within a single epoch of training. Method, training objective, experimental setup, and practical considerations are described so the study can be reproduced under tight resource limits. Quantitative results are TBD.

## Introduction

### Executive Introduction
Human pose classification (assigning a discrete label to a pose instance) is useful in activity recognition, human–computer interaction, and content moderation. Few-shot learning is a pragmatic approach when annotated pose examples per class are scarce. Under tight compute budgets, we prioritize simple, stable primitives (lightweight embedding networks, prototype-based classifiers, basic augmentations) and an episodic training regime that can run in one epoch or less.

### Problem Statement
Given a small number of labeled pose examples per class, learn an embedding and a classifier that generalizes to novel pose instances with minimal training. The compute constraint requires limiting training to a single epoch and using a small number of steps/episodes.

### Objectives
- Design a minimal, reproducible pipeline for few-shot human pose classification that fits within a single training epoch and low compute.
- Define a clear training objective and evaluation protocol suitable for small-shot regimes and constrained training.

### Research Question
Can a lightweight prototype-based few-shot pipeline produce useful pose classification behavior when trained within a single epoch under constrained compute?

### Contributions
- A compact methodology combining a small embedding network, prototype computation, and a cross-entropy training objective formulated for episodic few-shot learning, with equations and implementation-level decisions described.
- A constrained experimental recipe (datasets, splits, metrics, and budget) intended to be reproducible under the stated compute limits. Quantitative results are reported as TBD pending runs.

## Literature Review
Under tight compute, metric-based few-shot methods (prototype/prototypical-style approaches) are attractive because they require only a small classifier head and rely on distance comparisons in embedding space rather than large fully connected classifiers. Typical alternatives include fine-tuning pre-trained backbones and meta-learning optimizers; however, fine-tuning is often compute-heavy and meta-optimizers can be unstable with minimal data and training. Prototype-based methods trade some expressive power for simplicity and stability, making them an appropriate baseline for constrained experiments.

Key comparative points:
- Prototype-based metric learning: simple prototype computation; episodic training aligns with few-shot evaluation.
- Fine-tuning baselines: potentially stronger but more compute-intensive and prone to overfitting with very few examples.
- Meta-learning optimizers (MAML-like): powerful for adaptation but generally require many meta-training iterations, which conflicts with the single-epoch constraint.

## Methodology
We adopt an episodic prototype-based few-shot setup with a lightweight embedding network $f_\theta(\cdot)$. Each training episode samples a small support set $S$ and query set $Q$.

Model components:
- Embedding network $f_\theta$: a compact CNN or lightweight backbone; architecture and width = TBD.
- Prototype computation per class $k$:
$$
c_k = \frac{1}{|S_k|} \sum_{(x,y)\in S_k} f_\theta(x),
$$
where $S_k$ is the support set for class $k$.
- Distance metric: squared Euclidean distance
$$
d(z, c_k) = \| z - c_k \|_2^2.
$$
- Predictive distribution for query $x$:
$$
p(y=k \mid x) = \frac{\exp\big(-d(f_\theta(x), c_k)\big)}{\sum_{j}\exp\big(-d(f_\theta(x), c_j)\big)}.
$$

Training objective:
- Use cross-entropy (CE) loss on query examples within episodes. For a query $x$ with ground-truth class $y$:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(x) = -\log p(y \mid x).
$$
- Episode loss is the average CE over queries in the episode:
$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{episode}} = \frac{1}{|Q|} \sum_{x\in Q} \mathcal{L}_{\text{CE}}(x).
$$

Regularization and practical choices:
- Feature normalization (e.g., L2 normalization of embeddings) is optional; if used, apply after $f_\theta$ and before prototype computation.
- Simple augmentations: small geometric transforms and mild photometric jitter; exact parameters = TBD.
- Optimization: a single optimizer (e.g., SGD or Adam) with learning rate schedule = TBD; training runs limited to one epoch or less.

Implementation notes for reproducibility:
- Episodes correspond to N-way K-shot tasks; exact N and K values = TBD.
- Record random seed and all hyperparameters explicitly during runs (seed = TBD).

## Experimental Setup
Datasets and splits:
- Dataset(s) for human pose classification: dataset identifiers and paths = TBD.
- Splits: define training classes (base), validation classes (val), and test classes (novel). Exact split lists and sizes = TBD.

Evaluation metrics:
- Primary metric: accuracy (top-1) on query sets for episodic evaluation.
- Secondary metrics: precision, recall, and class-wise breakdowns as available.
- Report per-episode mean and standard deviation across evaluation episodes.

Training budget and constraints:
- Total training budget: at most one epoch over the provided training split (strict).
- Number of episodes per epoch, batch/episode size, and step counts = TBD (choose small values consistent with compute limits).
- Random seed(s): record explicitly (seed = TBD).
- Hardware: run on a low-resource device; device details = TBD.

Ablations and baselines:
- Baseline: prototype method with no augmentation.
- Ablations: with/without augmentation; with/without feature normalization.
- Additional baseline options (if compute allows): nearest-centroid in raw feature space, or a linear classifier trained on frozen embeddings (TBD).

Logging and checkpoints:
- Save checkpoints at small intervals or only the final model to conserve storage; checkpoint frequency = TBD.
- Record training loss curves, validation episodic accuracy, and sample qualitative visualizations of nearest-prototype assignments.

## Results
Quantitative results (validation/test metrics): TBD.

Report format to be produced when runs complete:
- Table of episodic accuracy (mean ± std) for each evaluated configuration (baseline and ablations).
- Per-class accuracy breakdown if available.
- Training loss curve across the single epoch (per-episode losses).
- Qualitative examples showing nearest-prototype assignment for selected queries.

Notes:
- No numerical claims are made here because experimental runs and reported metrics are pending (TBD).
- The report will adhere to the single-epoch constraint and will present raw metrics without smoothing or extrapolation.

## Discussion
Under the one-epoch constraint, prototype-based methods are desirable because they require learning embeddings that generalize by clustering support examples into class centroids rather than training a large classifier head. Expected behaviors and trade-offs:
- Pros: simplicity, low parameter overhead for the classifier, and stable episodic alignment to few-shot evaluation.
- Cons: limited optimization time likely leads to underfitting; embedding capacity must balance expressiveness and overfitting risk given few updates.
- Augmentation and normalization are low-cost interventions that can improve robustness with little compute overhead.
- Evaluation with few episodes and small K-shot tasks produces high variance; report mean and standard deviation over as many episodes as allowed by compute.

Practical recommendations:
- Prefer small, well-regularized embeddings over deep models when compute-limited.
- Use episode design that matches expected deployment N-way/K-shot conditions.
- Record seeds and hyperparameters so single-epoch stochasticity can be analyzed reproducibly.

## Conclusion
This compact report defines a reproducible, compute-constrained methodology for few-shot human pose classification using prototype-based metric learning and a cross-entropy training objective formulated over episode queries. The experimental recipe and evaluation protocol are specified to operate within a single epoch; quantitative results remain TBD pending runs.

## Future Work
- Run the specified experiments and populate the Results section with per-configuration quantitative metrics.
- Explore lightweight pretraining of the embedding (if allowed within compute constraints) to improve initial representations before episodic training.
- Investigate curriculum strategies for episode sampling that prioritize informative classes or hard negatives within the limited budget.

## Limitations
- No quantitative results are reported here; all numeric experiment items are marked as TBD until runs are executed.
- The single-epoch constraint restricts optimization and may understate model potential compared to standard multi-epoch training.
- Dataset-specific choices and hyperparameters are left as TBD; exact reproducibility requires filling these fields before running experiments.
- No external citations or prior-run numbers are included.
